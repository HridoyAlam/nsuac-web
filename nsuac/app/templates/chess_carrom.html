                Both tournaments used the Round Robin System to play their games. Individual participants took part in the chess event. However, in the Carrom event, players must first form a two-person team before they can compete. Both competitions are mixed gender, meaning they are available to both men and women.
 <br>
Players can take part in any of the event's segments. To participate in the event, players must first register, and the registration process in that event was based on a first-come, first-served basis. 

The registration process was held on 12th June 2019 & 13th June 2019 (10:30 AM - 05:30 PM) at the Plaza area.
